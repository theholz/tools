# Caddy Addons

This directory allows you to extend or override Caddy configuration without modifying the main `Caddyfile`.

All `.conf` files in this directory are automatically imported via `import /etc/caddy/addons/*.conf` at the end of the main Caddyfile.

## Use Cases

- Custom TLS certificates (corporate/internal CA)
- Additional reverse proxy rules
- Custom headers or middleware
- Rate limiting or access control

## Custom TLS Certificates

For corporate/internal deployments where Let's Encrypt is not available, you can use your own certificates.

### How It Works

The main `Caddyfile` imports a TLS snippet that all service blocks use:

```caddy
# In Caddyfile (top)
import /etc/caddy/addons/tls-snippet.conf

# In each service block
{$N8N_HOSTNAME} {
    import service_tls    # <-- Uses the snippet
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678
}
```

By default, the snippet is empty (Let's Encrypt is used). When you run `make setup-tls`, the snippet is updated with your certificate paths.

### Quick Setup

1. Place your certificates in the `certs/` directory:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/your/cert.crt ./certs/wildcard.crt
   cp /path/to/your/key.key ./certs/wildcard.key
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   make setup-tls
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Update `caddy-addon/tls-snippet.conf` with your certificate paths
   - Optionally restart Caddy to apply changes

### Reset to Let's Encrypt

To switch back to automatic Let's Encrypt certificates:

```bash
make setup-tls --remove
```

Or run directly:
```bash
bash scripts/setup_custom_tls.sh --remove
```

├── wildcard.crt                # Your certificate (gitignored)
└── wildcard.key                # Your private key (gitignored)
```

## Adding Custom Addons

You can create additional `.conf` files for custom Caddy configurations. They will be automatically loaded after the main Caddyfile.

Example: `caddy-addon/custom-headers.conf`
```caddy
# Add custom headers to all responses
(custom_headers) {
    header X-Custom-Header "My Value"
}
```

## Important Notes

- `tls-snippet.conf.example` is tracked in git (template with default Let's Encrypt behavior)
- `tls-snippet.conf` is gitignored and auto-created from template (preserved during updates)
- Other `*.conf` files are also gitignored (preserved during updates)
- Files in `certs/` are gitignored (certificates are not committed)
- Caddy validates configuration on startup - check logs if it fails:
  ```bash
  docker compose -p localai logs caddy
  ```
